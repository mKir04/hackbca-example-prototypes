# hackbca-example-prototypes

These are prototypes for SOME (not all) of the pages for the hackbca example webapp.

The prototypes are built with the Materialize Framework (https://materializecss.com/)

Each HTML file contains comments referencing relevant Materialize documentation.

Start by working through the versions of the homepage, index.html, in the index_progress folder. 

Then, check out events.html, eventform.html, and events/1.html.
